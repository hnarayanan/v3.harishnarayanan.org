	        <p>I am Dr. Harish Narayanan, a researcher (and occasional <a href="harmonising-whistleblowing.html">teacher</a>) with the <a href="http://comp-phys.engin.umich.edu/">Computational Physics Group</a> at the <a href="http://www.umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. Until a short while ago, I was a graduate student working toward my <acronym title="Philosophi&aelig; Doctor">PhD</acronym> in <a href="http://me.engin.umich.edu/">Mechanical Engineering</a> and <a href="http://cac.engin.umich.edu/">Scientific Computing</a>.</p>
		<p>With the completion of this journey in October 2007 (during the course of which I also received two master&#8217;s degrees: an <acronym title="Master of Science in Engineering"><a href="images/pages/degree.jpg">MSE</a></acronym> in Mechanical Engineering in December 2003 and an <acronym title="Master of Science"><a href="images/pages/degree-math.jpg">MS</a></acronym> in <a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/">Mathematics</a> in December 2006), I am not sure why I am still here.</p>

		<p>I work with professors <a href="https://me-web2.engin.umich.edu/zope/pubdir/bio?uniqname=krishna">Krishna Garikipati</a>, <a href="https://me-web2.engin.umich.edu/zope/pubdir/bio?uniqname=arruda">Ellen Arruda</a> and <a href="https://me-web2.engin.umich.edu/zope/pubdir/bio?uniqname=grosh">Karl Grosh</a>. Currently, we are looking at interesting questions relating to continuum field formulations to describe and simulate the biophysics of developing tissue.</p>
		<p>These pages contain links to <a href="research.html">our work</a> in greater detail, lists of <a href="publications.html">publications</a>, <a href="presentations.html">talks</a> I&#8217;ve given, and details regarding my <a href="coursework.html">coursework</a> and general academic progress. There is also the obligatory plug to my <a href="vita.html">vita</a>, now that it&#8217;s time for me to step out of graduate school.</p>

		  I wish my parents were a little more creative when it came to naming their son. As it turns out, there are numerous other Harish Narayanans all over the internet: namesake.com, flickr.com/namesake, firstname.wordpress.com, and a couple at blogspot.com. Needless to say, I have nothing to do with them, or their sites.
