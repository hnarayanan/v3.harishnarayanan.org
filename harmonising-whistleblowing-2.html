		<p>The sheer number of students involved&mdash;well over 200&mdash;ensured a wide variety in points of view, and the artificial sense of anonymity they enjoyed resulted in a degree of candidness I was surprised to see; sometimes brutally so. It's like they'd forgotten I've spent a dozen or so hours with them each week, and they're really not nameless to me.</p>

		<p>a few, extremely so,</p>
