		<p>I&#8217;ve been dabbling semi-seriously in photography for a while now. My weapons of choice include a <a href="http://consumer.usa.canon.com/ir/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=139&amp;modelid=10464">Canon EOS 20D</a> and a <a href="mirror/canon-eos-lenses.html">few lenses</a>, along with my trusty-old compact, the <a href="http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_product_lobbypage.asp?l=1&amp;p=16&amp;bc=2&amp;product=890">Olympus Camedia C-5050 Zoom</a>.</p>
		<img class="centered-photo" src="images/photos/My EOS 20D.jpg" alt="A picture of my camera" title="A glamour-shot of my preciousss, taken with my other preciousss" />
		<p>I have a few galleries up at different places, and run a <a href="http://delineate.wahgnube.org/">photo-journal</a>, which resulted in me being interviewed for a story in the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/us">Wall Street Journal</a>. I&#8217;ve also had <a href="images/photos/13_True Fans.jpg" rel="lightbox" title="True Fans">photograph of mine</a> be shortlisted in <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5262196.stm">BBC&#8217;s photographer of the year</a> contest in 2006. I thought that was pretty cool.</p>
		<p>And now, without further ado, here are some samples of my work!</p>

		<p>I am a trained (for about a dozen years; under a few talented teachers, including <a href="mirror/psn-article.html">P.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Narayanaswami</a>) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music">Carnatic</a> (south-Indian classical) vocalist. My claims to fame include winning nearly every music competition I&#8217;ve taken part in (my mom still holds on to the cups and trophies (Hi mom!)), performing on stage multiple times, and on national radio. I also play, among other things, a couple of percussion instruments.</p>
		<p>Recently however, I haven&#8217;t had the opportunity&mdash;or made the time to&mdash;perform, so most of my relationship with music has been that of an <a href="mixed-tape.html">informed critic</a>.</p>

		<p>It all began when I was a wee lad.</p>
		<p>Having parents who were easily enthused by travel and strong enough to drag their little boys along&mdash;kicking and screaming if need be&mdash;I started visiting places all over the world very early on. As I&#8217;ve grown older, it&#8217;s become apparent that I&#8217;ve acquired a taste for travel, and now quite enjoy it!</p>
		<p>Here are some snapshots from recent journeys across North America, Europe and India:</p>
