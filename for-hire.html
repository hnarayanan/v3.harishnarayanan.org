		<p>After a fruitful (by some estimates) half-decade in graduate school, I intend on wrapping-up my doctoral work by the end of the year (2007). Not relishing the fact that completing my program will officially leave me out-of-work, I would like to announce that I am keen on continuing in academia (or a lab, if persuaded) as a researcher.<sup>[<a href="#one">1</a>]</sup></p>
		<p>And by keen, I mean desperate.</p>
		<p>Some specific areas I&#8217;m currently interested in pursuing include:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>A priori performance evaluation of monolithic versus operator-splitting schemes for large-scale, multi-physics problems (Allowing me to delve into rigorous analysis of numerical methods, and contend with large-scale implementation issues)</li>
		  <li>Solutions of PDEs on differentiable manifolds, and the implications of modern geometry on mechanics theory (Encouraging me to learn more differential geometry, and apply this understanding to numerical analysis on manifolds and modern mechanics)</li>
		  <li>Gaining insight into the fundamental physics underlying intricate, real systems, and incorporating this understanding into constitutive theory (Expanding my knowledge beyond mechanics into areas like electromagnetic theory and biochemistry)</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="footnote"><a id="one"><sup>1</sup></a> In an alternate universe&mdash;where people are offered opportunities to do things without having any formal background or preparation&mdash;I would like a chance to hone my skills training full-time under an abstract photographer or digital artist, be financially supported while I leisurely work on my original musical scores and perform them, or have a publishing group show enough faith in me to coax me into polishing my comedic writing.</p>
