		<h3><a id="nid20070428">A fresh coat of paint!</a> <small>(2007-04-28)</small></h3>
		<p>For a few years now, the <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/information/id/1666/">earlier theme</a> that I&#8217;d created for this web site has served me surprisingly well.</p>
		<img class="centered-photo" src="images/pages/old-design.png" alt="A screen-shot of the old site design" title="The older, purely functional site design" />
		<p class="caption">The older, purely functional site design.</p>
		<p>Though it seemed rather spiffy when I first unveiled it, trends in web site design have evolved over these past few years. With rounded-corners, soft drop-shadows and splashes of colour being all the rage these days, it had begun to look a little long in the tooth.</p>
		<p>Not wanting to be left out, I&#8217;ve now come up with &#8220;Simplicity two-point-oh!&#8221;</p>
		<img class="centered-photo" src="images/pages/new-design.png" alt="A screen-shot of the new site design" title="The newer, softer site design!" />

		</p>
		<p>adding some much-needed colour, and I believe it captures the essence of the older theme, sprinkled with a dash of modernity.</p>
		<h3><a id="nid20050318">The &#8220;console&#8221; like <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> <small>(2005-03-18)</small></a></h3>
		<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write up random-yet-useful technical documentation and put it up on the site for a while now. In the process of going about determining what this entails, I ended up with the following style to signify console input/output.</p>
		<div class="console">[hnarayan&#64;localhost hnarayan]$ dmesg | tail

		<p>Personally, I think it looks pretty sweet. Useful or not, isn&#8217;t really pertinent.</p>
		<h3><a id="nid20050119">Sharing is a most natural impulse <small>(2005-01-19)</small></a></h3>
		<p>When I first started revamping this site over a year ago, one of my first priorities was to come up with a <a href="#nid20040110">simple, clean and professional</a> theme. It didn&#8217;t really take as much time as I had originally imagined to cook-up something I like. Since we all know sharing is a good thing, once I&#8217;d ironed out the minor kinks, I distributed the design this website uses on <a href="http://www.oswd.org/design/preview/id/1666/">oswd.org</a>, for <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> (as in &#8220;Free Press&#8221;).</p>
		<p>I think it was received quite well, as it has been downloaded thousands of times and has consistently maintained a high rating on the site. At various point, I&#8217;ve been pleasantly surprised with a friendly e-mail from a random stranger thanking me and showing me how they&#8217;ve gone about using it. I don&#8217;t remember the links to most those sites, but here are a few samples showing the design&#8217;s use in different places.</p>

		<p>When you see things like this, it makes you feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. Like I started off saying, sharing is a most natural impulse. Go with it.</p>
		<h3><a id="nid20040812">Site&#8217;s Hit Statistics Online <small>(2004-08-12)</small></a></h3>
		<p>I&#8217;ve now uploaded and <a href="#hitstats">linked to</a> this site&#8217;s hit statistics on a new section of this page. There is no real reason for you to be interested in any of this. But like I&#8217;d said earlier, this is supposedly psedo-technical notes to self. I just figured I&#8217;d satiate some primal urges of the number junkie sorts while I was going about my business.</p>
		<h3><a id="nid20040726">(Now Hidden) Site Articles <small>(2004-07-26)</small></a></h3>
		<p>There comes a time when you&#8217;ve done something <em>so many</em> times you cannot imagine doing it yet again. I&#8217;m now referring to answering to graduate school related questions from newbies. I&#8217;ve decided to put up a <a href="grad-school-faq.html">graduate school FAQ</a> page so that I can direct further queries from people to it.</p>
		<p>And so spawns a new class of currently <em>hidden article</em> pages. I refer to them as hidden because they aren&#8217;t obviously linked to from any of the other pages on the site. If someone comes up to me related topic or query, I&#8217;ll point them to it. Because I&#8217;m lazy, and that&#8217;s what lazy people do&mdash;minimize work.</p>
		<h3><a id="nid20040213">Testing Rendering of Equations <small>(2004-02-13)</small></a></h3>
		<p>Now for some equation tests, for when I finally decide to populate the <a href="research.html">research page(s)</a>. All of this has been done using <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/textogif/">TeX to GIF</a>. I have rendered a <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/"><acronym title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym></a> of the Schrodinger equation:</p>
		<img class="centered" src="images/pages/schrod.png" alt="Some trial image" title="Equation 1.1: How cool am I?" />
		<p class="caption">Equation 1.1: How cool am I?</p>
		<p>Not bad, if I do say so myself. I wasted a lot of time trying to do this in <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>. But that isn&#8217;t of great use since our friend <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp"><acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym></a> refuses to evolve.</p>
		<h3><a id="nid20040110"></a>Design Paradigm and Browser Inconsistencies <small>(2004-01-10)</small></h3>
		<p>This is my first real foray into the world of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/"><acronym title="The Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym></a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/"><acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym></a>. The site style is influenced a great deal by <a href="http://www.bluerobot.com/">BlueRobot</a> and concepts and code for the navigation menu were derived from <a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/">Listamatic</a>. There is a rather strict separation of content and style, which can be seen quite easily if you are using <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a>. If you are, look for the little crayons icon at the bottom left corner, and change the stylesheet to default.</p>
		<img class="centered-photo" src="images/pages/switch.png" alt="Switching to the default stylesheet" title="Switching to the default stylesheet" />
		<p>You will then see something like this,</p>
		<img class="centered-photo" src="images/pages/plain.png" alt="Plain unstyled content" title="Plain unstyled content" />
		<p>the plain unstyled content for the page.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, all testing was carried out <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/">Gecko</a> based browsers (<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/default.mspx">MS Windows</a>, <a href="http://galeon.sourceforge.net/">Galeon</a> on <a href="http://www.gnu.org/"><acronym title="GNU&#8217;s Not Unix!">GNU</acronym></a>/<a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>). After the style was finalized, testing on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.asp">Internet Explorer</a> revealed some arbitrary weirdness in rendering.</p>
		<img class="centered-photo" src="images/pages/weirdness.png" alt="Weird rendering in IE" title="Weird rendering in IE" />
		<p>I am not quite sure how this can be corrected at the moment, but I will in time.</p>
		<p>It does however, render very nicely even with text based browsers like <a href="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a>, and on graphical browsers, scales well with increasing/decreasing font size. There are no pixel based positioning schemes used in the style sheet. All of it is relative to the font size, so as that is changed, so will the relative postioning of the elements.</p>
		<img class="centered-photo" src="images/pages/scaled.png" alt="Rendered with font sizes scaled" title="Rendered with font sizes scaled" />
		<p>There is some level of site dynamism, and consistency between the pages is ensured by coding portions of the pages (<a href="genericheader.html">header</a>, <a href="genericfooter.html">footer</a>, actual content, &#8230;) separately and including common elements through <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/howto/ssi.html"><acronym title="Server Side Includes">SSI</acronym></a>. The <a href="genericnavigator.html">navigation menu</a> is generated on the fly for a given page using some rather elementary conditional <acronym title="Server Side Includes">SSI</acronym>. Subtle elements such as the page last updated timestamp are automatically handled too.</p>
		<p>All design goals revolved around keeping it aesthetically pleasing (and yet accessible), and ease of maintainence. In my mind I have met them both, and I hope that is enough to make sure I keep this up to date.</p>
