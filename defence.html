	        <p>If you&#8217;re curious as to what I&#8217;ve been doing in grad school for the past half-decade or so, stop by on <strong>Wednesday, October the 10<sup>th</sup> at 3:00&nbsp;PM at the Baer Room, 2906 Cooley Building</strong> for my talk on <strong>&#8220;A continuum theory of multiphase mixtures mixtures for modelling biological growth.&#8221;</strong></p>
		<p>Cooley is the nondescript building housing the Nukular Engineering department. It&#8217;s adjacent to the swanky Industrial and Operations Engineering building, and close to the fountain in front of the even swankier Lurie Engineering Center.</p>

		<p>The talk will undoubtedly suck, but there will be free food if I remember to buy some.</p>
